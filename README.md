# awesome-workshopper
*alternatively, awesome-adventure*

A list of workshopper/adventure-based tutorials for various things. Inspired by awesome. These are terminal-based guides to learning a new programming concept.

I also want to keep a running list of things there *should* be workshoppers for, so anyone wanting to jump in can.
